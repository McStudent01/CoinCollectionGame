# CoinCollectionGame
this is a repo for the coin collecting game 

[ X ] Casey McMillen: I have added comments where I felt it would make the best sense to place them for optimal clarity on what is what and where things are.
This layout is just an idea. but here are TODO's
1. All sound effects start as soon as game is loaded and not when they should be activated. We need to correct that.
2. Sizing of all icons (player, monster, powerUp etc. check preload for list of assets)
3. Ensure the game lasts until a score is set and not on a timer based. We need to implement gameWin logic, i am thinking setting a score threshold for win.    game just plays until then. Enemy hits deduct points. Catching coins add points.
4. Make sure background music loops through while game is being played.
5. Implement Scorecard/design
